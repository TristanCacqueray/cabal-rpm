## Misc
* run "cabal update" if package-version not found

- unify hackage and package deps into a common data structure
  with pkgShow and depShow to render strings
  * add RpmPackage and use Dependency

# Commands
- fetch
- aliases for missingdeps
- allow cmd abbreviations?

## Options
- command-based flags and help (optparse-applicative?)

## spec/packaging
- filter or blockformat literate code in description ("> ...")
- sort devel packages ignoring -devel suffix?
* common subpackage for binlib packages
- include README.*
- handle datafiles more automatically
  - clean away READMEs etc
- include version ranges in BRs
- use repoquery for missing testdeps
* label missing deps with comment
- --static binary package
- support tarballs again
- filter metapkgs like bytestring-builder and mtl-compat
- Use cabal-tweak-dep-ver for .cabal revisions

## version ranges
- warn about missing dependencies/versions

## standalone
- packaging of lib stacks into one deployable rpm
* support creating and building standalone package including its missing deps
  - phase 1: cabal sandbox
  - phase 2: embed src tarballs of missing deps

## local
- --no-network
- llvm flag
- running "cblrpm local pkg-ver" in pkg/ with existing pkg.spec when newer pkg exists builds old pkg
- use rpmspec + dnf/yum-builddep if needed to install deps not in .cabal

## install

## update
* maybe not save new spec file if missing deps
- reverse deps and rebuilds
- update with subpackages (preserve sources)

## depends
- dependency graphs or sorted recursive deps
- reverse dependencies
- using repoquery for uninstalled missingdeps
- use rpmspec when available?  (Centos5/6 too old)
- use su -c when no sudo ??
  - any way to know if user is sudoer?

## koji/buildsys
- support mock builds
