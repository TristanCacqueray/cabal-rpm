# Todo list

## Misc
* run "cabal update" if no ~/.cabal/
  or if package-version not found
- support pkg.buildinfo

- unify hackage and package deps into a common data structure
  with pkgShow and depShow to render strings
  * add RpmPackage and use Dependency

# Commands

## Options
- command-based flags and help

## spec/packaging

- llvm flag
- running "cblrpm local pkg-ver" in pkg/ with existing pkg.spec when newer pkg exists builds old pkg (or "cblrpm local pkg-ver")
