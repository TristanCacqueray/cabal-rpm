* add Begin/End comments on Source's, %setup and %files lists to improve update

## Misc
* run "cabal update" if package-version not found

- unify hackage and package deps into a common data structure
  with pkgShow and depShow to render strings
  * add RpmPackage and use Dependency

# Commands
- fetch
- aliases for missingdeps
- allow cmd abbreviations?

## Options
- command-based flags and help (optparse-applicative?)

## spec/packaging
- filter or blockformat literate code in description ("> ...")
- sort devel packages ignoring -devel suffix?
* common subpackage for binlib packages
- include README.*
- handle datafiles more automatically
  - clean away READMEs etc
? include version ranges in BRs

  - phase 2: embed src tarballs of missing deps

## local
- --no-network

- running "cabal-rpm local pkg-ver" in pkg/ with existing pkg.spec when newer pkg exists builds old pkg
- use rpmspec + dnf/yum-builddep if needed to install deps not in .cabal

## install
